              <strong>Usage data</strong>: in-app activity such as lessons

        </Section>

        <Section title="4. Cookies and Tracking">
          <p>

            across other websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're in a class, your teacher can see your lesson and
            challenge progress and whether you've completed journal entries,
            but never the contents of your journal.

            profiles. Student data stays under the school's control: schools may
            request access, correction, deletion, or export of their students'
            records at any time by emailing{' '}
